# The game is a fresh and modern RPG primarily focused on AI battle simulation using character decision trees and enemy data.
# Characters progress through PVE, PVP, Enhancements (Gear, Skills) and Upgrades.
# Battles between characters/enemies are simulated using a deathmatch turn-based gameplay in which character's behavior and battle decision making are governed by a decision tree depending upon the character's equipped combat chip.
# Battle experience data per kind of enemy or a certain other player is acquired through battle. At the end of the battle, the logged data can be encoded into an item containing the enemy's estimated stats and skills used in battle.
# Leveling up is done by consuming attribute upgrades.
# Loot can be acquired from enemies.
# Enhancements can be crafted (non-standard, traded in the black market) from loots or bought from NPCs (standard gears).
# An in-game currency will be established.
# Battles are only 1v1.
#

#   Skills:
#       Active Skills - executable protocols that can be equipped into a character's skill slot, allowing them to perform specific, resource-driven abilities.
#       They have the following constraints/attributes:
#           Can be used when equipped in the character's skill slot;
#           Generally costs NeuCharge;
#           Has a cooldown;
#           Can apply status effects;
#           Three active skills can be equipped at a time.
#       Passive Skills - always-active enhancements embedded in a character's core systems, providing continuous boosts or effects without requiring direct activation.
#           Only one passive skill can be equipped at a time.
#   Enhancements:
#       Rigs are gears that a character can equip to boost/enhance its battle stats. They could be the attached to the following:
#           Neural System (Boosts SYN based Battle Stats)
#           Arms (Boosts PWR based Battle Stats)
#           Body (Boosts END based Battle Stats)

#   Battle System:
#       The performance of a character in a battle simulation is heavily governed by the Combat Chip attached to it.
#       A Combat Chip (CC) is a specialized AI-driven module that, when slotted into a character's system, defines their decision-making algorithms and tactical behavior during battle. Each chip is programmed with a unique set of combat priorities, strategies, and response protocols, allowing characters to adapt dynamically to different combat scenarios based on the installed chip's design.
#   Core Upgrade:
#       A high-level systems enhancement that modifies a character's core functionality, granting bonuses that synergizes with the character class and unique perks. These upgrades act as modular enhancements, redefining the character's role and capabilities without altering their primary combat style, and can be swapped at will for strategic adaptability.
#       It can be unlocked at higher levels by equipping a core upgrade chip.
#   Battle Experience Data (BED):
#       After battling with a certain enemy type or another player, the character can encode the logged data into an item (BED). It contains the estimated battle stats of the enemy fought. Fully transferrable.
#   Status Effects:
#       Temporary conditions that affect a character's performance in battle. They can be positive or negative and can be applied by skills or some attacks.
